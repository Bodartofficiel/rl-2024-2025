# Reinforcement Learning - Academic year 2024-2025

This repository contains the files for the project of Reinforcement Learning, evaluation of the eponymous course.

## Task 1: Pre-specified environment
With the configuration file given in ’config.py’. Implement an instance of a
DQN from scratch (you may use the code of Lab sessions). Document the
training perfomance and the behavior of your agent. Describe and
explain the different phases in learning you observe.

## Task 2: Continuous actions
Choose an environment and configure it to continuous actions.
Implement the algorithm of your choice, possibly using code from Lab
sessions. Document the difference in behavior with your results on
highway with discrete actions.

## Task 3: Your choice of environment, Stable-baselines
Choose a third environment and use the StableBaselines library to train
an existing algorithm. 

## Task 4: An extra-experiment
Our choice: dig deeper into Task \#1 and Task \#2
